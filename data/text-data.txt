Hi! I’m Sean and I hack code. So, I’ll share to you more information.

First of all, my full name is Sean Francis N. Ballais. I went out of my mother’s womb on May 15, 1999, and I currently reside in Tacloban City, Philippines (Yes, the one that was hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan way back in November 8, 2013. But that’s another story for a another blog post). I’m an alumni (Batch 2015) of Philippine Science High School Eastern Visayas Campus. I’m currently enrolling in University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College.

I am interested in computer graphics.

Whenever I’m working on a software project, I usually prefer to develop the logical/backend side more than developing the frontend because developing the backend is way more fun than the frontend. Though at times, I would hack into the frontend because I need to link it to the backend or to fix some issue in it.
